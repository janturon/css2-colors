# css2-colors
CSS2 enables to use system colors (like *ButtonText*) instead of hard-coded colors (like *black*).

To see all usable combinations, display **css2-colors-preview.html** at your browser.

To include/modify pre-created css classes, look at the other file, **css2-colors.css**.

Note that these colors are officially deprecated in CSS3, but still supported in all major browsers. The reason for deprecation was to replace it by CSS3 appearance style which still lacks browsers support and even the standard needs to amend a lot of features here, while CSS2 colors is reliable cross-browser feature.
